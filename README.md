# page-analyzer

## History
This is one of my very very old projects.

## Usage

It is basically a bunch of analyses running over the HTML page, 
implemented currently as bookmarklet (or favelet if you want).

## Try

Go to [install page](http://ainthek.github.io/page-analyzer/favelets/analyzer/install.html)

# page-analyzer

It is basically a bunch of analyses running over the HTML page, 
implemented currently as bookmarklet (or favelet if you want).

## Try

Go to [install page](http://ainthek.github.io/page-analyzer/favelets/analyzer/install.html)

## History
This is one of my very very old projects.
Some of the code looks like it looks like since this seemed to run in IS 7 (or maybe even IE6) once.

## Future
Rewrite, reuse other algorithms, and add more detections, support node.js server side usage as well.
